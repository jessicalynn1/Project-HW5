# Project Proposal

I'd like to help users plan their perfect day at Disneyland Resort (CA). The landing page will be a form that the user will fill out.
Based on their responses, I will create an itinerary and display it on the next screen.

## Technologies Required

Themepark API: https://github.com/cubehouse/themeparks

## Data Model

There is a table for each question whose answer will get pushed to a comment table.
The association table will hold the data until all questions are answered.
Once all questions are answered, then the class is calculated and answer is displayed.

The question and class tables will have primary keys.
The association table will be using foreign keys to access the questions and class tables.

The structure is many (questions tables) to one (association table) to many (class tables).
